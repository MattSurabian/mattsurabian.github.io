      <description>This talk was given in September at DevOpsDays Boston.
The abstract for this talk was:

Enough to run 12 geographically distributed HA Vault deployments across multiple cloud providers. Even though the Open Source community provides us with some really awesome tooling, managing that many Vault environments can be tricky.</description>

The abstract for this talk was:

Thankfully there are lots of great community projects that are able to help; the trick is knowing which to leverage given your threat model.</description>
