      <description>At the end of 2014 I switched to Arch Linux from OS X. I&amp;rsquo;d though about making the switch before, and for the first time everything lined up to make it so.

      <description>I am not affiliated in any way with Rack Space or OpsCode, Iâ€™m just a user that loves the flexibility it offers me. I am a LAMP stack developer that uses Ubuntu.
