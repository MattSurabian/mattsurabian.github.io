Lots of people, not just developers, dream about working from home.  Whiling away the hours in the comfort of their castle and making a living at the same time.  Why not?  Everything is perfect when you’re working from home.  Nothing can interrupt or distract you.  Success is guaranteed, and just being there dissolves time management challenges and makes meeting deadlines a breeze.

 
Working from home solves all your problems… right?
------------------------
Ok, so maybe it’s not exactly that easy.  But it can be pretty sweet.  I’m no stranger to working from home, but my new role at [Crowd Fusion](http://www.crowdfusion.com) will be my first full time telecommuting position.  To get my head in the game for this shift in routine, I’ve come up with 10 Commandments that I feel must be followed to succeed at working from home.

This list is mainly things that have already worked for me, things I’ve seen several of my successful telecommuter friends do, and things that I want to do for myself.  I’m posting this list here as a reminder for myself to periodically reflect on it and be held accountable.  I have no idea what will be valuable or applicable in your situation.

 

\#1: Google Voice Number
-------------------------
I used to be paranoid about google voice, because I’m an idiot.  The bottom line here is communication.  If you’re not communicating you’re not doing your job correctly.  By using google voice you can be completely in-touch and reachable when you need to be, and completely unplugged and removed when you need to be.  Further, because you can monitor your calls and voicemail with email, you are able to remain accountable and informed even when you’re “unplugged”, so nothing has to fall through the cracks.

\#2: Standing Desk (workspace of your choice)
-------------------------
A playa’ needs a playground.  For me that’s a standing desk.  I don’t mind standing all day, and it helps to keep me engaged and moving around, which is important to me.  You don’t necessarily need a standing desk, but you do need a place you can go for work only.  Just like you need to strike a communication balance, you need to strike a workspace balance.  Having a dedicated and efficient place to work, no matter the setup, makes it easier to stay focused and hold yourself accountable.

\#3: Get An Air Purifier
-------------------------
Ok, so this is hot button and frivolous, I get that.  Ionic ones can release crazy amounts ozone, and most don’t really work or are cheaply manufactured.  For some it brings to mind a yuppie germaphobe stigma.  All I know is that I live in the woods in a tractor shed that was converted into a cabin and it gets pretty damn dusty.  If I’m going to be spending the bulk of my waking hours in a single room, I’m thinking I should at least attempt to control the dust situation.  Both for me, my allergies, and my equipment.

\#4: Gym Schedule
-----------------
Your mileage may vary on this one.  But it’s no joke, I could stand to lose 15-20 pounds.  Being a programmer isn’t exactly the most physically demanding job.  I’m fortunate to live right down the street from my gym and since I don’t have to commute anymore I’ve picked up an extra hour and a half of time formerly spent sitting in my car.

You might not need to lose any weight, but I think it’s important to make time for moving around, it doesn’t have to be going to the gym.  Sitting around your house working all day, then sitting around your house eating and monkeying around all night is pretty damn sedentary.  Aside from being healthy, you’ll be more productive and happier with your work by being more physically active.

\#5: Going out to lunch
------------------------
The culture of people eating at their desks is one of the worst things a 9-5 life has brought to society.  Sure, sometimes you’ve got to do it to meet a deadline and there’s nothing wrong with that.  But constantly eating alone and at your desk is bad for you!  I have absolutely no way to prove this, but I don’t even care because it’s so obviously true.

Walking away from your workspace and socializing with other people allows your mind to digest what you’re doing and what you’ve yet to do.  Just a few minutes away from your workspace with some good food and good friends can clear your head and lead to a satisfying productive day.  It keeps you in control of your time.

\#6: Identify Vice
----------------
Be aware of the things that distract you and take control of them.  Being a telecommuter means there is no one to catch you playing video games, working on a personal project, watching tv, or laying in a hammock with a rum drink instead of working.  So you need to hold yourself accountable.  Don’t play the justification or reward game, ’cause it’s a slippery slope.  When you’re working act like you’re at an office, the sooner you do the more success you’ll have.  If you are unable to do this, you will fail.

\#7: Breakfast – It’s the new lunch
---------------------------
I love lunch.  I can’t explain why, it’s just a great, great thing.  Usually by lunchtime I’ve got a good idea what I’ll be working on for the rest of the day and have a clear plan of attack.  That little break away from my workspace helps me to come back and really be productive until it’s time to go home.  Plus eating food is just all around awesome.  I don’t think I’m alone in this love of lunch either.

In contrast I find most people aren’t super productive in the morning.  They’re still a bit tired and it takes a while to really get into work mode.  By taking the time to make and enjoy a proper breakfast in the morning (which is easy with no commute) you can hit your productivity stride earlier and get more done.  Ah the power of food and thought!

\#8: Backup
-----------
Backup your files.  Backup your files.  Backup your files.  Backup your files.  Any system that works will do.  Don’t be afraid to pay for it.  Stop being so cheap.  Backup your files.

\#9: Communication – What?
--------------------------
Working from home requires clear and concise written and verbal communication skills.  Take the time to choose your words carefully so that other people working with you can understand you.  Make sure to listen to others intently so you’re informed about what’s going on.  No one works in a vacuum.  It’s important to speak openly about expectations and goals on a day to day basis.  You don’t want to find out at 4 o’clock that you’ve let your team or your customer down.

\#10: Appreciate
----------------
You are living the dream and that’s pretty great.  There are a lot of people jammed in some “Office Space” kind of place wishing they could work from home, and you owe it to them to live it up and succeed at it.  Make sure to find time everyday to appreciate telecommuting and all the people and technologies that make it possible for you.
